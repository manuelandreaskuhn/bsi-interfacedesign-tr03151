  <name>ErrorCertificateExpired</name>
  <description>This exception is thrown if a SE API function is invoked and the certificate corresponding to a private key used to create log messages is expired. Even if a certificate is expired, the log message SHALL be created by the Secure Element and stored by the device. In this case, the exception ErrorCertificateExpired SHALL be raised only after the data of the log message has been stored. This is a warning exception that indicates the operation succeeded but with a certificate validity concern.</description>

  <javadoc>
    <summary>This class defines the exception ErrorCertificateExpired that is thrown if a SE API function is invoked and the certificate with the public key for the verification of the appropriate type of log messages is expired.</summary>
    <description>The ErrorCertificateExpired exception indicates that a function has successfully completed its primary operation (creating and storing a log message), but the certificate used for signing the log message has expired. Unlike typical exception scenarios where the operation fails, this exception is raised AFTER the log message has already been created and stored by the Secure Element. This design ensures that log messages are persisted even when the signing certificate is no longer valid, maintaining logging continuity. Applications should treat this as a warning condition indicating that certificate renewal or replacement may be necessary, while acknowledging that the log message operation succeeded. The expired certificate does not prevent logging but does indicate a potential security or compliance issue that requires attention.</description>

    <requirement>The exception SHALL be raised if a function is invoked and the certificate corresponding to a private key used to create log messages is expired. Even if a certificate is expired, the log message SHALL be created by the Secure Element and stored by the device. In this case, the exception ErrorCertificateExpired SHALL be raised only after the data of the log message has been stored. This ensures that logging continues despite certificate expiration, but the application is notified of the certificate validity issue.</requirement>

    <scenario name="Scenario 1: Certificate Expiration Detection and Notification">
      <description>A logging operation completes successfully and raises ErrorCertificateExpired.
