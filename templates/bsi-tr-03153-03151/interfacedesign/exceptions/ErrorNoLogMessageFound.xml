  <name>ErrorNoLogMessageFound</name>
  <description>This exception is thrown if the SE API functions getLastLogMessage or exportLogMessages cannot find any log message parts in the Secure Element's logging storage. The functions attempt to retrieve or export log messages, but the logging storage either contains no messages at all or has been cleared. ErrorNoLogMessageFound indicates that the Secure Element's transaction logging system has no recorded log entries to return to the caller.</description>

    <summary>This class defines the exception ErrorNoLogMessageFound that is thrown if no log message parts have been found in the Secure Element.</summary>
    <description>This exception is thrown when log message retrieval or export functions attempt to access transaction log messages but find that no log messages exist in the Secure Element's storage. Functions such as getLastLogMessage and exportLogMessages are used to retrieve recorded log entries from the device's transaction logging subsystem. ErrorNoLogMessageFound is raised when these functions search the logging storage and find it empty - no log entries are available to retrieve or export. This is an expected condition when the logging storage has not yet accumulated entries or when log messages have been deleted. Recovery requires confirming that logging is enabled and functioning, or verifying that expected events have actually been logged on the device.</description>

    <section>3.3.1 Event Logging and Log Message Retrieval - getLastLogMessage and exportLogMessages</section>
    <requirement>The functions getLastLogMessage and exportLogMessages SHALL retrieve transaction log message entries from the Secure Element's logging storage. If the logging storage contains no log message entries (i.e., it is empty), these functions SHALL raise the exception ErrorNoLogMessageFound. This exception indicates that the requested log messages do not exist in the device's storage - it is an expected condition when no events have been logged or when previously logged messages have been deleted.</requirement>

  <notes>
    <note>ErrorNoLogMessageFound is thrown by getLastLogMessage and exportLogMessages - both log message retrieval functions</note>
    <note>This exception indicates the logging storage contains no messages - it is an expected condition, not a system error</note>
    <note>The exception has Medium severity because it indicates empty storage, not a device failure</note>
    <note>Log messages may be absent for legitimate reasons: logging disabled, no events logged yet, or recent message deletion</note>
    <note>Applications should distinguish between "no messages available" (ErrorNoLogMessageFound) and log retrieval operation failures</note>
    <note>Transaction logging must be enabled for the device to record log messages - disabled logging will result in empty storage</note>
    <note>The type and amount of events that generate log messages depend on the device's logging configuration and event policies</note>
    <note>Log messages may be removed by explicit deletion operations (deleteLogMessages) or automatic retention policies</note>
    <note>The getLastLogMessage function retrieves the most recent log message - ErrorNoLogMessageFound means no messages exist at all</note>
    <note>The exportLogMessages function exports all logged messages or filtered subsets - ErrorNoLogMessageFound means no messages match the criteria</note>
    <note>Different device models may have different default logging settings and event logging policies</note>
    <note>Applications should wait for operations to complete before retrieving logs - retrieving immediately after device initialization may yield empty logs</note>
    <note>Log message retrieval is typically read-only - ErrorNoLogMessageFound has no side effects on device state</note>
    <note>Comprehensive logging requires appropriate configuration of which events are logged and what information is captured</note>
    <note>Monitor logging status and event logging capacity to understand when to expect populated versus empty log storage</note>

      <description>After initializing a new Secure Element, an application calls getLastLogMessage to verify that logging is working.

    <scenario name="Scenario 3: Transaction Verification with Log Availability Check">
      <description>An application performs transactions on a device and then calls getLastLogMessage to retrieve the log entry for the most recent transaction.

    <scenario name="Scenario 4: System Monitoring with Event Logging Confirmation">
      <description>A monitoring system periodically calls exportLogMessages to check for logged events. When ErrorNoLogMessageFound is raised on a new or recently reset device, it indicates the device is in a fresh state with no logged events yet. The system can use this to track device lifecycle and event history.</description>

      <errorContext>No messages on fresh device - normal initialization state</errorContext>

  </usage>
  <implementationContext>
    <note>The getLastLogMessage and exportLogMessages functions must check logging storage and report empty storage as ErrorNoLogMessageFound</note>
    <note>Transaction logging must be enabled on the device for log messages to be recorded - disabled logging results in empty storage</note>
    <note>Log messages are generated by device operations - no operations means no messages (even with logging enabled)</note>
    <note>Applications should verify logging is enabled and operational before expecting to retrieve log messages</note>
    <note>Log storage capacity and retention policies determine the lifespan of messages - old messages may be automatically deleted</note>
    <note>Explicit log deletion operations (deleteLogMessages) clear storage and will result in ErrorNoLogMessageFound until new messages are logged</note>
    <note>Error handling should distinguish between empty storage (ErrorNoLogMessageFound) and actual retrieval failures (other exceptions)</note>
    <note>Applications performing multi-phase operations should account for the time needed for operations to be logged before retrieving logs</note>
    <note>Some devices may support log message filtering and queries - these may also return no results if no messages match filter criteria</note>
