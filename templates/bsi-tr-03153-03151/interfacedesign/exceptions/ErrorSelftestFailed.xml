  <name>ErrorSelftestFailed</name>
  <description>This exception is thrown if the execution of the self-tests of the Secure Element components fails. The selfTest function performs comprehensive integrity checks of device components, cryptographic modules, storage subsystems, communication interfaces, and security functions to verify the device is operating correctly. If any self-test check fails or reports a failure condition, the device indicates a potential integrity issue or malfunction. ErrorSelftestFailed indicates that the device may not be trustworthy for security operations. Common causes include: component failures, cryptographic test failures, memory errors, communication issues, configuration problems, or manufacturing defects. The device should not be used for critical operations until the self-test failure is investigated and resolved.</description>

    <summary>This class defines the exception ErrorSelftestFailed that is thrown if device self-test execution fails.</summary>
    <description>This exception is thrown when the selfTest function attempts to verify the integrity and correct operation of Secure Element components but encounters a failure. Self-test is a critical diagnostic function that validates cryptographic modules, storage integrity, communication interfaces, security processor functionality, and overall device health. ErrorSelftestFailed indicates that one or more self-test checks have failed, revealing potential device malfunctions or integrity issues. Common causes include: component hardware failures, cryptographic module errors, memory corruption, communication subsystem issues, configuration errors, or manufacturing defects. ErrorSelftestFailed is a Critical severity exception because it indicates the device may not be trustworthy for security operations. Failed self-tests suggest the device should not be used for sensitive transactions. Recovery requires investigating the specific test failure, potential hardware repair, or device replacement. The device manufacturer should provide detailed self-test failure analysis capabilities.</description>

  <specification>
    <source>BSI TR-03151-1</source>
    <section>3.2.8 Device Diagnostic Operations - selfTest</section>
    <requirement>The function selfTest SHALL execute comprehensive self-tests of all critical Secure Element components including cryptographic modules, storage subsystems, communication interfaces, security processors, and firmware. If any self-test check fails or detects a component malfunction, the function SHALL raise ErrorSelftestFailed. Self-tests are used to verify device integrity and correct operation. Self-test is typically invoked during device initialization, periodically during operation, or when device issues are suspected. If self-test fails, the device may not be trustworthy for security operations and should not be used until the failure is investigated and resolved.</requirement>
