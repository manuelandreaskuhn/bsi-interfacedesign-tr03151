  <name>ErrorGetTimeSyncVariantFailed</name>
  <description>This exception is thrown if the SE API function getTimeSyncVariant fails to retrieve the supported time synchronization variant. The function attempts to determine which time synchronization mechanism and configuration the Secure Element supports, but the retrieval process fails before the time sync variant can be determined and returned.</description>

  <javadoc>
    <summary>This class defines the exception ErrorGetTimeSyncVariantFailed that is thrown if the determination of the supported time synchronization variant failed.</summary>
    <description>This exception is thrown when the getTimeSyncVariant function cannot retrieve the supported time synchronization variant from the Secure Element. Time synchronization variant information describes which time synchronization mechanism and protocol variant the Secure Element supports for time synchronization operations. ErrorGetTimeSyncVariantFailed indicates that the Secure Element cannot provide the synchronization variant due to hardware failure, firmware information storage corruption, internal time management system errors, communication failures, or Secure Element state restrictions. When this exception occurs, no time sync variant is returned and applications cannot determine which time synchronization strategy is supported by this device. Recovery typically involves device verification, time management subsystem diagnostics, and firmware inspection if the failure persists.</description>

    <section>3.2.5 Time Management - getTimeSyncVariant</section>
    <requirement>The function getTimeSyncVariant SHALL query the Secure Element to determine the supported time synchronization variant. If the Secure Element cannot provide or return the required time sync variant information, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorGetTimeSyncVariantFailed and exit without returning any variant data. The time sync variant retrieval failure indicates the Secure Element's time management query functionality could not complete successfully.</requirement>

      <scenario>Time management hardware failure</scenario>
      <description>The Secure Element's time management hardware malfunctions or becomes inaccessible, preventing time sync variant retrieval</description>
      <trigger>The Secure Element's time management or device capabilities hardware malfunctions or experiences read errors. When getTimeSyncVariant is called, the time sync variant query is sent to the Secure Element, but the hardware cannot provide valid capability data. The function receives a failure status from the Secure Element, triggering ErrorGetTimeSyncVariantFailed.</trigger>

      <scenario>Time management metadata corruption</scenario>
      <description>The Secure Element's time management configuration or time sync variant metadata becomes corrupted or is lost</description>
      <trigger>The Secure Element's memory containing time management capabilities, time sync variant configuration, or synchronization mechanism information becomes corrupted, experiences data loss, or is marked as inaccessible due to storage errors. When getTimeSyncVariant attempts to read the variant, the data cannot be reliably retrieved, triggering ErrorGetTimeSyncVariantFailed.</trigger>

      <scenario>Time management subsystem internal error</scenario>
      <description>The Secure Element's time management or capabilities subsystem encounters critical errors that prevent variant enumeration</description>
      <trigger>The Secure Element's time management subsystem (responsible for maintaining and providing time-related capabilities and variant information) encounters an internal error, deadlock, or exception. When getTimeSyncVariant is called, the time management system cannot process the query, triggering ErrorGetTimeSyncVariantFailed.</trigger>

    <condition>
      <scenario>Device-to-Secure Element communication failure during variant query</scenario>
      <description>The communication channel between device and Secure Element is disrupted during time sync variant retrieval</description>
      <trigger>A communication failure occurs while getTimeSyncVariant transmits the capability query to the Secure Element or while receiving the variant response. The command may be corrupted, the response may be incomplete, or the communication link may be temporarily unavailable. The function receives a communication error status, triggering ErrorGetTimeSyncVariantFailed.</trigger>
    </condition>
    <condition>
      <scenario>Secure Element in restricted or error state prohibiting time capability access</scenario>
      <description>The Secure Element is in a locked, restricted, or error state that prevents external queries for time capability information</description>
      <trigger>The Secure Element enters a state where time capability queries or time management information access is not permitted. When getTimeSyncVariant is called and the Secure Element's state prohibits capability access, the function receives a state-related rejection, triggering ErrorGetTimeSyncVariantFailed.</trigger>

    <state name="Device Operational State">Device remains fully operational and unmodified. The failure to retrieve the time sync variant does not affect device initialization state, time management capabilities, internal memory, stored data, or the ability to perform other operations. All device components remain in their pre-call state.</state>
    <state name="Time Sync Variant Return Status">No time sync variant is returned to the caller. The function exits without providing any synchronization variant information. Applications must not assume default time sync variants or cached information; they must handle the exception as indicating time synchronization capability enumeration is unavailable.</state>
    <state name="Secure Element Time Management State">Secure Element time management subsystem remains unchanged by the failed query. No state modifications, capability changes, or time configuration changes occur. Time management operations continue normally regardless of the retrieval failure.</state>
    <state name="Time Synchronization Capability Continuity">Time synchronization capabilities continue to be maintained internally in the Secure Element. The failure to retrieve the variant does not affect time management or time synchronization operations. Variant queries can be retried once the underlying issue is resolved.</state>
    <state name="No Cascading State Effects">No cascading state inconsistencies or secondary failures occur as a result of the variant query failure. Device internal consistency is maintained. Other SE API functions and time management operations continue normally without state corruption.</state>
    <state name="Recovery Preconditions Met">The device state after exception is consistent and allows for recovery operations. The underlying issue (hardware error, communication error, time management error) remains present, but the device is stable enough to accept diagnostic queries or recovery attempts.</state>
