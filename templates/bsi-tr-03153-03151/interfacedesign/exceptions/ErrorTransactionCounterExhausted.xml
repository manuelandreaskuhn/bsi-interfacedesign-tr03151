  <description>This exception is thrown if the physical memory of the transaction counter has been exhausted and can no longer guarantee error-free operation. The transaction counter maintains a record of all executed transactions in persistent memory to ensure authenticity and non-repudiation. The physical memory is a finite resource that can become exhausted after many transactions. When memory approaches or reaches saturation, the counter cannot reliably record new transactions. ErrorTransactionCounterExhausted is a Critical severity exception because it prevents all transaction operations and indicates device maintenance is urgently required. The device must be serviced to restore or replace the counter memory before transaction functionality can resume.</description>

    <summary>This class defines the exception ErrorTransactionCounterExhausted that is thrown if the physical memory of the transaction counter is exhausted and can no longer guarantee error-free operation.</summary>
    <description>This exception is thrown when the transaction counter's physical memory has been exhausted and cannot guarantee reliable recording of new transactions. The transaction counter maintains a persistent record of all executed transactions for authenticity and non-repudiation purposes. Physical memory resources are finite and can become exhausted after many transactions. When memory is exhausted, the counter cannot reliably record transactions and ErrorTransactionCounterExhausted is raised. This is a Critical severity exception because transaction functionality is completely blocked. All transaction operations (startTransaction, updateTransaction, finishTransaction) cannot proceed. Device maintenance is required to restore or replace counter memory. ErrorTransactionCounterExhausted indicates a serious device resource limitation requiring immediate intervention.</description>

    <requirement>The Secure Element maintains a transaction counter in persistent memory to record all executed transactions. This counter is essential for authenticity and non-repudiation. Physical memory for the counter is a finite resource. If counter memory becomes exhausted such that error-free operation cannot be guaranteed, the Secure Element SHALL raise ErrorTransactionCounterExhausted and block all transaction operations. This Critical severity exception indicates urgent device maintenance is required. The device must be serviced to restore or replace counter memory before transaction functionality can resume.</requirement>
