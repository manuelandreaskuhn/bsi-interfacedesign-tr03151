  <name>ErrorRestoreFailed</name>
  <description>This exception is thrown if the SE API function restoreLogsFromBackup fails to restore transaction log messages from a backup into the Secure Element. The function attempts to restore previously exported log data back into the device's logging storage, but the restore operation fails due to device error, incompatible backup data, device storage issues, or other failure conditions. ErrorRestoreFailed indicates that the backup data could not be successfully restored and the device's log storage remains in its state prior to the restore attempt.</description>

    <summary>This class defines the exception ErrorRestoreFailed that is thrown if the backup restore operation fails.</summary>
    <description>This exception is thrown when the restoreLogsFromBackup function attempts to restore transaction log messages from a backup but encounters a failure. Backup restore is a critical operation used to recover previously logged data or migrate logs between devices. ErrorRestoreFailed indicates that the restore operation could not be completed successfully. Common causes include: incompatible backup data format, corrupted backup data, device storage issues, insufficient device storage capacity, device communication failures, or device internal errors. ErrorRestoreFailed is a Critical severity exception because it indicates data recovery has failed and audit trail information may be lost. Recovery requires investigating the backup data integrity, device state, and resolving the underlying issue before attempting restore again.</description>

    <section>3.3.4 Backup and Restore Operations - restoreLogsFromBackup</section>
    <requirement>The function restoreLogsFromBackup SHALL restore transaction log messages from a backup (previously exported log data) into the Secure Element's logging storage. If the restore operation cannot be completed successfully due to incompatible backup data, corrupted backup, device storage issues, insufficient capacity, communication failure, or other device-level error, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorRestoreFailed. The backup data must be in the correct format and structure for the device and backup period to restore successfully. If the restore fails, the device's log storage remains unchanged - partial restores are not committed to the device.</requirement>
