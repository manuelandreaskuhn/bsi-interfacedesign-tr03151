  <name>ErrorResettingRetryCounterFailed</name>
  <description>This exception is thrown if the SE API function unblockPin fails to reset the PIN retry counter as part of the PIN unblocking operation. The function successfully unblocks the PIN and sets a new PIN, but fails when attempting to reset the failed attempt counter to zero. ErrorResettingRetryCounterFailed indicates that while the PIN is unblocked, the retry counter was not properly reset, potentially leaving the account in an inconsistent state where the PIN is usable but the retry counter is not reset.</description>

    <summary>This class defines the exception ErrorResettingRetryCounterFailed that is thrown if the PIN retry counter reset fails during PIN unblocking.</summary>
    <description>This exception is thrown when the unblockPin function successfully unblocks the user's PIN and sets a new PIN but fails to reset the failed PIN attempt counter to zero. When a PIN is unblocked via the unblockPin function, the device should perform two operations: 1) Unblock the PIN and set a new PIN, and 2) Reset the failed attempt counter to zero. ErrorResettingRetryCounterFailed indicates that operation 1 succeeded but operation 2 failed. The result is that the PIN is now unblocked and can be used for authentication, but the retry counter still reflects the previous failed attempts. This leaves the account in a potentially inconsistent state - the next failed PIN attempt may immediately trigger a re-block if the counter still shows high failed attempts. ErrorResettingRetryCounterFailed is a High severity exception that indicates a partial failure in the PIN unblocking process. Recovery requires ensuring the retry counter is properly reset so the account is in a consistent state.</description>

  <specification>
    <source>BSI TR-03151-1</source>
    <section>3.1.2 PIN Unblocking - unblockPin</section>
    <requirement>The function unblockPin SHALL unblock a user's blocked PIN by verifying the provided PUK and creating a new PIN. The unblock operation consists of multiple steps: verification of PUK, creation of new PIN, and reset of the failed PIN attempt counter to zero. If the PUK verification and new PIN creation succeed but the retry counter reset fails, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorResettingRetryCounterFailed. In this partial failure scenario, the PIN is unblocked and the new PIN is set, but the retry counter remains at its previous value. The device should ensure transaction consistency - if the retry counter reset fails, the entire unblock operation should either be rolled back or explicitly noted as partially complete.</requirement>

    <condition>
      <scenario>Device storage write failure during retry counter reset</scenario>
      <description>PIN is unblocked successfully but device fails to write the reset retry counter value to storage</description>
      <trigger>The unblockPin function successfully verifies the PUK and sets a new PIN. When attempting to reset the retry counter, the device encounters a storage write failure. The counter remains at its old value and ErrorResettingRetryCounterFailed is raised.</trigger>
    </condition>
    <condition>
      <scenario>Device communication failure during counter reset step</scenario>
      <description>PIN unblock and new PIN set succeed but communication fails during the retry counter reset transmission</description>
      <trigger>The unblockPin function completes PIN unblocking and new PIN setting. When transmitting the command to reset the retry counter, device communication is lost. The counter reset is not confirmed and ErrorResettingRetryCounterFailed is raised.</trigger>
    </condition>
    <condition>
      <scenario>Device internal error during retry counter update</scenario>
      <description>Secure Element reports an internal error when attempting to update the retry counter</description>
      <trigger>The unblockPin function successfully completes PIN-related operations. When the device attempts to update the retry counter, it encounters an internal error (hardware issue, verification failure, etc.). ErrorResettingRetryCounterFailed is raised.</trigger>
    </condition>
    <condition>
      <scenario>Partial transaction rollback leaves counter unreset</scenario>
      <description>A partial transaction or atomic operation failure leaves the retry counter in an unreset state</description>
      <trigger>The unblockPin operation uses an atomic transaction to update PIN and counter. The transaction fails on the counter update step but the PIN update is already committed. The counter remains unreset and ErrorResettingRetryCounterFailed is raised.</trigger>
    </condition>
    <condition>
      <scenario>Device resource exhaustion during counter reset</scenario>
      <description>Device lacks resources to complete the retry counter reset operation</description>
      <trigger>The PIN is successfully unblocked but the device runs out of resources (memory, processing) when attempting to reset the retry counter. ErrorResettingRetryCounterFailed is raised.</trigger>
