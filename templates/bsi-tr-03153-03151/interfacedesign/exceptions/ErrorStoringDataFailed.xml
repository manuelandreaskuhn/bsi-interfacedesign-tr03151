    <name>ErrorStoringDataFailed</name>
    <description>This exception is thrown if a storage operation fails when attempting to store data on the device. The Secure Element stores various types of data including device description, configuration parameters, and operational data. If the storage write operation fails, ErrorStoringDataFailed indicates the data could not be successfully written to device storage. Common causes include: device storage errors, storage write failures, corrupted storage, insufficient storage capacity, storage medium issues, or communication failures. ErrorStoringDataFailed indicates that the requested data update was not completed and the device's stored data remains unchanged. This prevents configuration updates and data management operations from completing successfully.</description>

        <summary>This class defines the exception ErrorStoringDataFailed that is thrown if data storage operations fail.</summary>
        <description>This exception is thrown when a storage write operation fails while attempting to store data on the Secure Element. The device stores configuration, description, and operational data that must be persisted reliably. ErrorStoringDataFailed indicates that a data storage operation (typically setDescription or initialize) could not complete successfully. Common causes include: device storage write errors, storage medium issues, corrupted storage, insufficient storage capacity, or communication failures during write. ErrorStoringDataFailed is a High severity exception because it prevents configuration updates and data management. The device's stored data remains in its previous state - the failed write does not update the data. Recovery requires investigating the storage issue and potentially retrying the operation or addressing underlying storage problems.</description>

        <section>3.2 Device Configuration and 3.3.1 Device Information Operations - Data Storage</section>
        <requirement>The Secure Element stores device configuration and operational data including device description and initialization data. Operations that update stored data (setDescription, initialize) must persist the data reliably to device storage. If a data storage operation fails to successfully write data to device storage, the function SHALL raise ErrorStoringDataFailed. The device's stored data remains unchanged if the write fails. Data storage failures must be reported clearly so the caller knows the operation did not complete. Storage failures may require addressing underlying storage issues before retry.</requirement>
