  <name>ErrorNoDataAvailable</name>
  <description>This exception is thrown if the SE API export functions cannot find any data matching the provided selection or filter criteria. The functions exportLogMessages or exportFilteredTransactionLogs attempt to export stored data (log messages, transaction records, or other logged information) based on the caller's filtering or selection parameters, but no data in the Secure Element's storage matches those selection criteria. ErrorNoDataAvailable indicates that the export query returned an empty result set - the requested data simply does not exist or has been purged from the device.</description>

    <summary>This class defines the exception ErrorNoDataAvailable that is thrown if no data has been found for the provided selection in the context of the export of stored data.</summary>
    <description>This exception is thrown when export functions attempt to retrieve and export stored data based on selection criteria but find that no data matches the specified criteria. Functions such as exportLogMessages and exportFilteredTransactionLogs accept filtering parameters (e.g., date range, event type, client ID, transaction ID) to specify which stored data should be exported. ErrorNoDataAvailable is raised when the Secure Element searches its storage using these criteria and finds zero matching records. This is an expected condition when no data matches the filter, not an error condition - it indicates the export operation cannot proceed because there is no matching data to export. Recovery requires adjusting the selection criteria (expanding date ranges, removing filters, etc.) to find matching data, or confirming that the expected data has not been logged or has been deleted.</description>

    <section>3.3.2 Data Export Operations - exportLogMessages and exportFilteredTransactionLogs</section>
    <requirement>The functions exportLogMessages and exportFilteredTransactionLogs SHALL search the Secure Element's storage for data matching the provided selection or filter criteria and export matching data. If the Secure Element searches the storage based on the provided selection criteria and finds no matching data (i.e., the result set is empty), the functions SHALL raise the exception ErrorNoDataAvailable. This exception indicates that no data matches the selection criteria - it is an expected condition, not a device error.</requirement>

      <description>The selection criteria (date range, time window, event type) does not match any stored data</description>
      <trigger>The application calls exportLogMessages with a date range (e.g., January 1-10, 2020) but the Secure Element only contains log entries from 2025. The export function searches for matching records in the specified date range, finds none, and raises ErrorNoDataAvailable.</trigger>

    <condition>
      <scenario>Storage is empty or purged</scenario>
      <description>The Secure Element's data storage contains no records at all or all records have been deleted</description>
      <trigger>The device was recently initialized or all stored data has been deleted via purge operations. An export function attempts to export data but finds no records matching any criteria. ErrorNoDataAvailable is raised.</trigger>
    </condition>
    <condition>
      <scenario>Event type filter matches no logged events</scenario>
      <description>The filter specifies a particular event type that has never occurred or does not exist in the stored logs</description>
      <trigger>The application calls exportLogMessages with a filter specifying event type "EventTypeX" but this event type has never been logged. The export function searches the logs for this event type and finds no matching entries. ErrorNoDataAvailable is raised.</trigger>

    <condition>
      <scenario>Client ID filter matches no transactions</scenario>
      <description>The filter specifies a client ID that has no associated transaction records</description>
      <trigger>The application calls exportFilteredTransactionLogs with a filter for client ID "UnknownClient" that does not exist in the transaction logs. The export function searches for transactions by this client and finds none. ErrorNoDataAvailable is raised.</trigger>

    <condition>
      <scenario>Combined filter criteria produce empty result set</scenario>
      <description>Multiple filter conditions together produce an empty result (while each individual filter might match some data)</description>
      <trigger>The application calls exportFilteredTransactionLogs with complex filter criteria combining date range AND client ID AND transaction state. While data exists for each filter individually, the combination of all filters matches no records. ErrorNoDataAvailable is raised.</trigger>

    <scenario name="Scenario 1: Audit Log Export with Date Range Specification">
      <description>An audit system attempts to export transaction logs for a specific date range (e.g., "December 1-10, 2025"). When exportFilteredTransactionLogs raises ErrorNoDataAvailable, it indicates no transactions occurred on the device during that date range. The system responds by expanding the date range or checking if transactions actually occurred during the specified period.</description>

    </scenario>
    <scenario name="Scenario 2: Event Type Filtering with Selective Data Discovery">
      <description>A monitoring application attempts to export only specific event types (e.g., "PinEntry" events). When ErrorNoDataAvailable is raised, it indicates either that no such events have been logged or that all such events have been deleted. The application adapts by trying broader event type filters or querying available event types first.</description>

    <scenario name="Scenario 3: Transaction Log Export with Complex Filtering">
      <description>An enterprise system exports transaction logs with complex filter criteria (date range AND client ID AND transaction state). When exportFilteredTransactionLogs raises ErrorNoDataAvailable, it indicates that while data may exist for individual filter criteria, the combination of all filters matches no records. The system responds by progressively loosening filters to identify which criteria eliminate all matching data.</description>

    <scenario name="Scenario 4: Device Status Verification After Initialization or Purge">
      <description>After device initialization or data purge operations, an application attempts to export existing data. When ErrorNoDataAvailable is raised, it confirms that the device storage is empty (as expected after purge or new initialization). The application can then proceed with validation or configuration knowing the device state.</description>
