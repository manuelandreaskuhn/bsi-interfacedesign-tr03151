  <name>ErrorSignatureCounterExhausted</name>
  <description>This exception is thrown if the physical memory of the signature counter can no longer guarantee error-free operation. The signature counter is a critical component that maintains a monotonically increasing counter value for digital signatures on transactions, providing audit trail integrity and replay attack protection. The physical storage backing the signature counter has limited write cycles. When the physical memory approaches or exceeds its safe operational limits, the device can no longer guarantee the integrity of the signature counter. ErrorSignatureCounterExhausted indicates the signature counter storage is exhausted and the device cannot safely continue operations that require signature counter increments. This is a Critical condition requiring immediate administrative attention and device maintenance or replacement.</description>

    <summary>This class defines the exception ErrorSignatureCounterExhausted that is thrown if signature counter physical memory is exhausted.</summary>
    <description>This exception is thrown when the physical memory backing the signature counter has reached exhaustion or a state where it can no longer guarantee error-free operation. The signature counter is a critical component that maintains a monotonically increasing counter for transaction signatures, providing audit trail integrity and replay attack protection. The physical storage has limited write cycles (typically Flash or EEPROM memory). ErrorSignatureCounterExhausted indicates that the memory has been written so many times that future writes cannot be guaranteed to succeed reliably. Common causes include: excessive transaction volume over device lifetime, signature counter write-through on every transaction, exceeding expected device lifecycle, or device reaching end-of-life. ErrorSignatureCounterExhausted is a Critical severity exception because it prevents further transaction processing and indicates device requires maintenance or replacement. The device cannot safely accept new transactions if the signature counter cannot reliably record them.</description>

    <section>3.3.2 Transaction Operations and 3.3.3 Logging Operations - Signature Counter Management</section>
    <requirement>The Secure Element maintains a signature counter that is incremented for each transaction, providing audit trail integrity and replay attack protection. The signature counter is backed by physical memory with limited write endurance (typically 100,000 to 1,000,000 write cycles for Flash/EEPROM). When the physical memory backing the signature counter approaches or exceeds its safe operational limits, the device SHALL raise ErrorSignatureCounterExhausted on any operation requiring signature counter increment (startTransaction, updateTransaction, finishTransaction, configureLogging). The device must not accept new transactions when signature counter memory is exhausted, as this compromises audit trail integrity.</requirement>
