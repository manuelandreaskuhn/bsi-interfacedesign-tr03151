  <name>ErrorGetOpenTransactionsFailed</name>
  <description>This exception is thrown if the SE API function getOpenTransactions fails to retrieve the list of currently open transactions being managed by the Secure Element. The function attempts to obtain detailed information about all active transactions in progress, but the retrieval process fails before the transaction list can be determined and returned.</description>

    <summary>This class defines the exception ErrorGetOpenTransactionsFailed that is thrown if the determination of open transactions that are currently managed by the device failed.</summary>
    <description>This exception is thrown when the getOpenTransactions function cannot retrieve the list of open transactions from the Secure Element. Open transactions information provides detailed enumeration of all currently active transactions in progress, including transaction IDs and status information. ErrorGetOpenTransactionsFailed indicates that the Secure Element cannot provide the transaction list due to hardware failure, storage corruption, internal transaction management system errors, communication failures, or Secure Element state restrictions. When this exception occurs, no transaction list is returned and applications cannot enumerate or inspect active transactions. Recovery typically involves device verification, transaction management subsystem diagnostics, and possible hardware diagnosis if the failure persists.</description>

    <section>3.4.6 Transaction Management - getOpenTransactions</section>
    <requirement>The function getOpenTransactions SHALL query the Secure Element to determine the list of all currently open transactions being managed. If the Secure Element cannot provide or return the required transaction list, the function SHALL raise the exception ErrorGetOpenTransactionsFailed and exit without returning any transaction data. The open transaction retrieval failure indicates the Secure Element's transaction enumeration query functionality could not complete successfully.</requirement>

    <condition>
      <scenario>Transaction registry hardware failure</scenario>
      <description>The Secure Element's transaction registry hardware malfunctions or becomes inaccessible, preventing transaction list retrieval</description>
      <trigger>The Secure Element's transaction registry storage hardware fails or experiences read errors. When getOpenTransactions is called, the transaction list query is sent to the Secure Element, but the hardware cannot provide valid transaction data. The function receives a failure status from the Secure Element, triggering ErrorGetOpenTransactionsFailed.</trigger>
    </condition>
    <condition>
      <scenario>Transaction registry data corruption</scenario>
      <description>The Secure Element's transaction registry or active transaction tracking data becomes corrupted or is lost</description>
      <trigger>The Secure Element's memory containing transaction registry, active transaction tracking tables, or transaction metadata becomes corrupted, experiences data loss, or is marked as inaccessible due to storage errors. When getOpenTransactions attempts to read the transaction list, the data cannot be reliably retrieved, triggering ErrorGetOpenTransactionsFailed.</trigger>
    </condition>
    <condition>
      <scenario>Transaction management subsystem internal error</scenario>
      <description>The Secure Element's transaction management subsystem encounters critical errors that prevent transaction enumeration</description>
      <trigger>The Secure Element's transaction management subsystem (responsible for managing transactions and providing transaction state) encounters an internal error, deadlock, or exception. When getOpenTransactions is called, the transaction management system cannot process the enumeration query, triggering ErrorGetOpenTransactionsFailed.</trigger>
    </condition>
    <condition>
      <scenario>Device-to-Secure Element communication failure during transaction query</scenario>
      <description>The communication channel between device and Secure Element is disrupted during open transaction list retrieval</description>
      <trigger>A communication failure occurs while getOpenTransactions transmits the transaction query to the Secure Element or while receiving the transaction list response. The command may be corrupted, the response may be incomplete, or the communication link may be temporarily unavailable. The function receives a communication error status, triggering ErrorGetOpenTransactionsFailed.</trigger>
    </condition>
    <condition>
      <scenario>Secure Element in restricted or error state prohibiting transaction access</scenario>
      <description>The Secure Element is in a locked, restricted, or error state that prevents external queries for transaction information</description>
      <trigger>The Secure Element enters a state where transaction queries or transaction enumeration is not permitted. When getOpenTransactions is called and the Secure Element's state prohibits transaction access, the function receives a state-related rejection, triggering ErrorGetOpenTransactionsFailed.</trigger>

    <state name="Device Operational State">Device remains fully operational and unmodified. The failure to retrieve open transactions list does not affect device initialization state, transaction operations, internal memory, stored data, or the ability to perform other operations. All device components remain in their pre-call state.</state>
    <state name="Transaction List Return Status">No transaction list is returned to the caller. The function exits without providing any open transaction information. Applications must not assume default transaction lists or cached information; they must handle the exception as indicating transaction enumeration is unavailable.</state>
    <state name="Secure Element Transaction Management State">Secure Element transaction management subsystem remains unchanged by the failed query. No state modifications, transaction changes, or transaction management configuration changes occur. Transaction management operations continue normally regardless of the retrieval failure.</state>
    <state name="Active Transaction Continuity">Active transactions continue to progress and be managed internally in the Secure Element. The failure to retrieve the transaction list does not affect ongoing transaction operations or state. Transaction queries can be retried once the underlying issue is resolved.</state>
    <state name="No Cascading State Effects">No cascading state inconsistencies or secondary failures occur as a result of the transaction query failure. Device internal consistency is maintained. Other SE API functions and transaction operations continue normally without state corruption.</state>
    <state name="Recovery Preconditions Met">The device state after exception is consistent and allows for recovery operations. The underlying issue (hardware error, communication error, management system error) remains present, but the device is stable enough to accept diagnostic queries or recovery attempts.</state>
